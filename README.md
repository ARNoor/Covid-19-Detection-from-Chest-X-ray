# Covid-19-Detection-from-Chest-X-ray
This project was done using Tensorflow library. Dataset from Kaggle was used where images of chest x-rays were given that consisted of covid, virus and normal cases. The task was to detect the covid ones with better recall. A CNN model was built, then tested and later MobileNet architecture was used using transfer learning that gave better results.
